Praying...

Let us...
Listen to the joyful noises
Around us
And also inside ourselves,

You'll find God's love hide and locked somewhere there.
Hidden by our fear.
Locked by our arrogance.

Take heart, walk through winds,
remember that
God made His throne on loving waters of your heart..

Spread the true and unconditional love again...
