## Rules for well-crafted Code:
 - build functions with one and only one thing to do.
 - Always let's code Extendable not modifiable.
 - Composable Features.
 - More is less, develop minimal features.
 - Never invent the wheel, use the well-tested other libraries.

## Object Oriented Programming Pillars:
 - Abstraction.
 - Encapsulation.
 - Inheritance.
 - Polymorphism.

## Fucntional Should-Be's for nonfunctional language:
 - Constraints should be precisely stated via type. 
 - Generic Options should heave generic interfaces
 - Partial Operations should be encoded as total Operations
 - Lazy evaluation should be useful default.
 - Pure and Impure Operations should be separted.

 ## Functional Programming Pillars:
  - Data In, Data Out.
  - Immutability.
  - Lazy evaluation.
  - Strongly-Typed.
  - Declarative Style.
